QUESTIONS FOR SATYA: (03/22)
1) I created a test mthod "public void VerifyOurCoffeeLink()" I was trying verify that on starbucks page there is a link
called "Our Coffee". When I run the test, the test fails and I get error message "Link not found"

2) I was trying to first login and when logged in, place orders. I created test method " public void PlaceOrder()"
When I execute the test, it logs in but it does not take me to logged in page where I can place order.

3) I have manually logged in and collected the web elements of some items. I want to write a test, that logs me in, 
place order of two items. Need Help.

4) My goal is to write few tests, such as a) place breakfast order b) ensure few links are present of page,
c) functionality such as login works. Once I am done with these test cases, I want to write those tests in specsflow.
